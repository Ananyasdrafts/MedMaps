# MedMaps

Welcome to the MedMaps repository! This project aims to track patients' heart rate, diabetes, and drug intake to predict necessary safety checkups before it's too late. Additionally, it features a drug-drug interaction checker and optical character recognition (OCR).

## Features

### Health Monitoring and Prediction
- **Input:** Patient heart rate, diabetes status, and insulin intake.
- **Output:** Predicts when a safety checkup is needed.
- **Model:** Utilizes LSTMs and Attention Mechanisms for accurate tracking and prediction.

### Drug-Drug Interaction Checker
- **Input:** Two medication names.
- **Output:** Information on potential interactions and side effects.

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- **Input:** Text from medical prescriptions.
- **Output:** Extracted and analyzed data for monitoring and prediction.
